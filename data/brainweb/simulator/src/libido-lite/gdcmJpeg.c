/* This half of the example shows how to read data from the JPEG decompressor.
 * It's a bit more refined than the above, in that we show:
 *   (a) how to modify the JPEG library's standard error-reporting behavior;
 *   (b) how to allocate workspace using the library's memory manager.
 *
 * Just to make this example a little different from the first one, we'll
 * assume that we do not intend to put the whole image into an in-memory
 * buffer, but to send it line-by-line someplace else.  We need a one-
 * scanline-high JSAMPLE array as a work buffer, and we will let the JPEG
 * memory manager allocate it for us.  This approach is actually quite useful
 * because we don't need to remember to deallocate the buffer separately: it
 * will go away automatically when the JPEG object is cleaned up.

/*
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 *
 * The JPEG library's standard error handler (jerror.c) is divided into
 * several "methods" which you can override individually.  This lets you
 * adjust the behavior without duplicating a lot of code, which you might
 * have to update with each future release.
 *
 * Our example here shows how to override the "error_exit" method so that
 * control is returned to the library's caller when a fatal error occurs,
 * rather than calling exit() as the standard error_exit method does.
 *
 * We use C's setjmp/longjmp facility to return control.  This means that the
 * routine which calls the JPEG library must first execute a setjmp() call to
 * establish the return point.  We want the replacement error_exit to do a
 * longjmp().  But we need to make the setjmp buffer accessible to the
 * error_exit routine.  To do this, we make a private extension of the
 * standard JPEG error handler object.  (If we were using C++, we'd say we
 * were making a subclass of the regular error handler.)
 *
 * Here's the extended error handler struct:
 */

struct my_error_mgr {
  struct jpeg_error_mgr pub;	/* "public" fields */
  jmp_buf setjmp_buffer;	/* for return to caller */

  /* We could postpone this until after returning, if we chose. */

/*
 * SOME FINE POINTS:
 *
 * In the above code, we ignored the return value of jpeg_read_scanlines,
 * which is the number of scanlines actually read.  We could get away with
 * this because we asked for only one line at a time and we weren't using
 * a suspending data source.  See libjpeg.doc for more info.
 *
 * We cheated a bit by calling alloc_sarray() after jpeg_start_decompress();
 * we should have done it beforehand to ensure that the space would be
 * counted against the JPEG max_memory setting.  In some systems the above
 * code would risk an out-of-memory error.  However, in general we don't
 * know the output image dimensions before jpeg_start_decompress(), unless we
 * call jpeg_calc_output_dimensions().  See libjpeg.doc for more about this.
 *
 * Scanlines are returned in the same order as they appear in the JPEG file,
 * which is standardly top-to-bottom.  If you must emit data bottom-to-top,
 * you can use one of the virtual arrays provided by the JPEG memory manager
 * to invert the data.  See wrbmp.c for an example.
 *
 * As with compression, some operating modes may require temporary files.
 * On some systems you may need to set up a signal handler to ensure that
 * temporary files are deleted if the program is interrupted.  See libjpeg.doc.
